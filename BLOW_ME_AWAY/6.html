Blow me away is a fun Interactive Installation which responds to the change in pressure generated by blowing air through one's mouth. The narrative is centred around mischievous Bob who leaves no stone unturned to create problems for kevin.
Are you willing to help this innocent Kevin from the troublemaker?
<br>
<br>
The project was done as a part of course Physical Computing under the supervision of Dr. Keyur Sorathia in the month of Nov, 2017.

The project was deeply inspired by MIT's Interactive computing projects: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9j8DIHXSKA" id="" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; ">Living wall</a>, which experiments with interactive wallpaper that can be programmed to monitor its environment, control lighting and sound and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI-6wMlaVTc" id="" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: none; ">Electronic Popables</a>, which is an interactive pop-up book that sparkles, sings, and moves that works by integrating traditional pop-up mechanisms with thin, flexible, paper-based electronics.

<br>
<br>

The setup was made using a laptop screen which was decorated by the cardboard and paper cuttings. The Sensors, Circuits and Arduino were placed deceptively on side of the setup and characters were added to the scene to give a more appealing look to it.
<br>
<br>
Different sequences of videos were made in the cinema 4D taking into consideration smooth transition between two such scenes.The background music and sound effects further brought the sense of liveliness to the scene.

<br>
<br>

The electrical components consisted of the Piezoelectric Sensor which was connected to the simple circuit and the output went directly to Arduino which triggered change in the video sequences based on the input received.
